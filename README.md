### Project Description

This project focuses on the descriptive analysis of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks through 2D Visualization using data taken from mergeWednesday.csv. This project aims to analyze DDoS attacks by observing the characteristics of network traffic data. This project is useful for early detection of DDoS attacks through identifiable characteristics of observed network communication data, as well as providing informative and easy-to-understand visualizations of network communication data in the form of graphs and mappings used in the analysis.
